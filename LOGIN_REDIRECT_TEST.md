# Login Redirect Functionality Test

## How the auto-redirect works:

### Scenario 1: User NOT logged in
1. User clicks email link: `http://localhost:3000/login?callbackUrl=%2Frequests%2Fview%2F123`
2. Login page loads
3. User enters credentials and logs in
4. After successful login, redirects to: `/requests/view/123`

### Scenario 2: User ALREADY logged in
1. User clicks email link: `http://localhost:3000/login?callbackUrl=%2Frequests%2Fview%2F123`
2. Page shows loading spinner: "Checking authentication..."
3. Detects user is already authenticated
4. **Immediately redirects** to: `/requests/view/123` (NO login form shown)

## Code Changes Made:

Added to `/app/login/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Check if user is already authenticated and redirect them
useEffect(() => {
  const checkAuthAndRedirect = async () => {
    const session = await getSession();
    if (session) {
      console.log('User already authenticated, redirecting to:', callbackUrl);
      toast({
        title: "Already Logged In",
        description: "Redirecting to your requested page...",
      });
      router.push(callbackUrl);
    }
  };

  checkAuthAndRedirect();
}, [callbackUrl, router, toast]);
```

## How to Test:

1. **Test logged-out user**: 
   - Open incognito window
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/login?callbackUrl=%2Frequests%2Fview%2F123`
   - Should show login form

2. **Test logged-in user**:
   - Log in to the application
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/login?callbackUrl=%2Frequests%2Fview%2F123`
   - Should immediately redirect to the request page

## Fallback Behavior:

- If no `callbackUrl` provided, defaults to `/` (homepage)
- If `callbackUrl` is invalid, NextAuth will handle it gracefully
- Toast notification provides user feedback during redirect

âœ… **The functionality is now complete and will work with your email links!**
