## Backup Approver Level-Aware Reversion - Fix Summary

### Problem Description
The backup approver reversion logic was not level-specific, causing incorrect approval assignments when backup periods expired. 

**Scenario:**
- Level 1: Tommy (original approver)  
- Level 2: Robert (original approver)
- Backup Config: Tommy backs up for Robert

**When request created:**
- Level 1: Tommy ✅ (no backup needed)
- Level 2: Tommy ✅ (diverted from Robert → Tommy)

**When backup expired (BEFORE FIX):**
- Level 1: Robert ❌ (incorrectly changed)
- Level 2: Robert ✅ (correctly reverted)

**Expected behavior (AFTER FIX):**
- Level 1: Tommy ✅ (unchanged - he was original)
- Level 2: Robert ✅ (reverted from Tommy → Robert)

### Root Cause
The `approval_diversions` table did not track which specific approval was diverted. The reversion logic used pattern matching that could affect multiple approvals assigned to the same backup approver.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
Added `approval_id` field to `approval_diversions` table:
```sql
ALTER TABLE approval_diversions ADD COLUMN approval_id INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE approval_diversions ADD CONSTRAINT fk_approval 
  FOREIGN KEY (approval_id) REFERENCES request_approvals(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

#### 2. Diversion Creation Enhancement
Updated backup approver routing to store the specific approval ID:
```typescript
await prisma.approval_diversions.create({
  data: {
    request_id: requestId,
    original_approver_id: originalApproverId,
    backup_approver_id: backupConfig.backupApprover.id,
    approval_id: approvalRecord.id, // ← NEW: Track specific approval
    backup_config_id: backupConfig.configId,
    diversion_type: 'automatic',
    notes: 'Approval routed to backup approver',
  },
});
```

#### 3. Reversion Logic Enhancement
Updated reversion to use precise approval targeting:
```typescript
// NEW: Use approval_id for precise reversion
if (diversion.approval_id) {
  const targetApproval = await prisma.requestApproval.findUnique({
    where: { id: diversion.approval_id }
  });
  
  // Only revert this specific approval
  if (targetApproval && targetApproval.approverId === backupApproverId) {
    await prisma.requestApproval.update({
      where: { id: targetApproval.id },
      data: {
        approverId: originalApproverId,
        approverName: originalApproverName,
        approverEmail: originalApproverEmail,
      },
    });
  }
}
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Precise Targeting**: Each diversion now tracks exactly which approval was diverted
2. **Level Independence**: Level 1 and Level 2 approvals are reverted independently  
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy diversions (without approval_id) use fallback logic
4. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key relationship ensures data consistency

### Testing Results

From the test run:
- ✅ New diversions have `approval_id` populated (Diversion 67: approval_id: 248)
- ✅ Precise approval tracking works (Level 2 approval correctly identified)
- ✅ Legacy diversions still supported (9/10 older diversions use fallback logic)
- ✅ No more incorrect level assignments during reversion

### Data Correction Applied

Fixed existing problematic requests where both levels incorrectly had Robert's ID:
- ✅ **6 requests corrected**: Level 1 changed from Robert (ID: 9) → Tommy (ID: 1)
- ✅ **Level 2 preserved**: Kept as Robert (ID: 9) - correct original assignment
- ✅ **Verification passed**: All requests now show proper level assignment:
  - Level 1: Tommy (ID: 1) ✅
  - Level 2: Robert (ID: 9) ✅

### Files Modified

1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added approval_id field and relation
2. `lib/backup-approver-service.ts` - Enhanced reversion logic  
3. `lib/backup-approver-routing-service.ts` - Store approval_id during diversion
4. `app/api/requests/route.ts` - Store approval_id during request creation

### Impact

- **Fixed**: Level-specific reversion ensures only intended approvals are reverted
- **Improved**: Precise tracking eliminates guesswork in reversion logic
- **Maintained**: Backward compatibility with existing data
- **Enhanced**: Better audit trail with approval-level diversion tracking

The issue where "Level 1 becomes Robert also Level 2 is Robert" when "Level 1 should still be Tommy" is now resolved. Each approval level is independently tracked and reverted only when specifically diverted for that level.
